Hello! I'm Jack Rodriguez, and this is my first-ever Robot Controller. 

  Some needed context:
I initially did not do this project while using GIT. That is why there is only one Commit.
I also do not have access to the many files provided to show off. I did not work on these files at all, so I didn't need to add them here.
I know this isn't too impressive, but I am very proud of this project and wanted it in my repositories.

  This project was my introduction to WeBots, VSCode (I had only ever used VS), and Python as a language!
I had to learn quite a bit to get the robot to work as I wanted it. Learning Python on the fly was, fortunately, very easy, as I had prior experience with much harder languages.
Most of my issues came from how the code interacted with the simulation itself. What worked in my calculations didn't often work in the simulation.
This was due to factors like friction, slippage, and reader locations. 
As can be seen in the provided video and report on my LinkedIn or Handshake, the robot does not move perfectly, but it does complete the track quite well.

My robot follows a series of directions depending on what current step in the maze it is on. At each step, it calculates the amount of time it should try and attempt a certain move. 
This time is calculated using values like distance traveled, type of turn needed, and a given distance/radius. 
The robot also displays the needed information as it travels through the maze.

Overall, this robot and the report took about 40 hours. I am quite proud of it, and I learned so much!
